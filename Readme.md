***This program is an Underwater Imaging System project designed to address various challenges in capturing images in underwater environments. This program is designed to control a Basler camera and a laser module using the Pylon API and the WiringPi library.*** 

It captures images from the camera and saves them to disk, synchronized with the laser signal. The program is particularly useful for applications requiring precise timing between image captures and external events, such as in Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) systems.

* Power should at least higher than **18 V.** (In order to make laser run) 

* **22 V** would be the best.

* The line that has been connect has the voltage **12 V**.

* The Camera(Basler) can only set delta t higher than 9.1 ms.

* More Information please check the [Hardware Configuration](#hardware-configuration)
 
### üîó Requirement library

This code is a C++ program that leverages various libraries and headers to facilitate a range of functionalities. Here's a detailed breakdown of each component:

1. **Pylon Library**:
    
    * `#include <pylon/PylonIncludes.h>`: This includes the essential header files from the Pylon library. Pylon is a comprehensive set of tools and libraries used for acquiring, processing, and displaying images from different types of cameras. The included files likely contain functions and classes necessary for camera interaction.
        
    * `#include <pylon/ParameterIncludes.h>`: This includes header files that handle camera parameters. This might encompass settings like exposure, gain, and other configurations that can be adjusted on the camera.
        
    * `#include <pylon/BaslerUniversalInstantCamera.h>`: This includes specific headers tailored for Basler cameras. Basler is a prominent brand of industrial cameras known for their high-quality imaging capabilities.
        
2. **WiringPi Library**:
    
    * `#include <wiringPi.h>`: This includes the WiringPi library, which is a set of functions designed for working with the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins on a Raspberry Pi. In this context, it is likely being used for handling signals, possibly related to hardware interactions.
3. **Standard C++ Libraries**:
    
    * `#include <iostream>`: This provides access to the standard input/output stream functionalities. It's used for reading and writing data through the console.
        
    * `#include <ctime>`: This includes functions and types related to date and time operations.
        
    * `#include <chrono>`: This introduces elements from the C++ standard library for handling time.
        
    * `#include <sstream>`: This header supports string stream processing, allowing operations on strings as if they were input/output streams.
        
    * `#include <iomanip>`: This provides tools for manipulating stream input and output. It's often used for formatting.
        
    * `#include <cstdio>`: This is part of the C standard input/output library, offering basic input and output functions.
        
    * `#include <cstdlib>`: This includes general utilities functions and macros.
        
    * `#include <cstring>`: This provides functionality for handling C-style strings.
        
    * `#include <sys/stat.h>` and `#include <sys/types.h>`: These headers are for working with file information and file system attributes.
        
    * `#include <string>`: This includes the standard C++ string class, allowing for the manipulation and handling of strings.
        
    * `#include <unistd.h>`: This includes various standard symbolic constants and types. It often deals with system calls.
        
4. **File Operations**:
    
    * `#include <fstream>`: This brings in the necessary tools for performing file input and output operations.
        
    * `#include <unordered_map>`: This includes the header for an unordered associative container, which maps unique keys to values. This can be very useful for efficient data retrieval based on unique identifiers.
        
5. **Multithreading**:
    
    * `#include <pthread.h>`: This header belongs to the POSIX threads library, which offers functions for creating and managing threads. This enables the program to execute multiple tasks concurrently, potentially improving performance and responsiveness.


## Quick Started

### 1. Capture pcitures 
Each time when connect with camera, it should be initialized first.

```bash
# go to the main code
cd ./cam_cpp/build

# run codes
./piv
```

### 2. Edit source code

If you need to edit the script,
```bash
cd ./cam_cpp/source
```
`piv.c` is the target source script.

If you need to compile it, type
```bash
make
```
It will create the target obejct file and executable file in foler `build`
### 3. Other commands

Trun on laser
```bash
cd ./cam_cpp/build
./laser_on
```

Trun off laser
```bash
cd ./cam_cpp/build
./laser_off
```

Clean the data folder
```bash
cd ./cam_cpp
bash ./commands/clean_data.sh
```

Pack the data folder for download
```bash
cd ./cam_cpp
bash ./commands/pack_data.sh
```


## Configuration

the config.ini sample can be written as:
**Before you edit the config file, make sure the parameter's name are correct.**

```ini
; Sample Test Case
exposure_time_in_ms = 7
dt_in_ms = 10 
Frequency = 10
Duration_in_sec = 20
Height = 400
Width = 1000

; delta t should higher than 9
; The following parameters are used to set the camera's parameters.
; The parameters are set using the following formula:
; num_cameras = Frequency * Duration_in_sec * 2

```
## Troubleshooting

Here are the problems happend normally.

*  **The laser's light is low**
    Check the power first

* **Error: Timeout Exception**

    `terminate called after throwing an instance of 'GenICam_3_1_Basler_pylon::TimeoutException'
Aborted` 
    **This reason might caused by the camera buffer, this might happen in the first time running codes**


## Backup Tech-Configuration

### Software Architecture

This section elucidates the data flow among different directories and outlines the purpose each directory serves in this system.

* `data`: This directory is intended for storing image files that are used or generated by the application. It is the primary location for all picture-related data.
    
* `assets`: This directory contains media files that are utilized in the `Readme.md` for documentation purposes. Typically, it includes images that are embedded within this document to illustrate concepts or to provide examples.
    
* `build`: Here, you will find all compiled files. This includes `piv.o`, which is an object file, and the final executable named `piv`. This is where the build process outputs its results.
    
* `download`: This directory is used for packaging. It compiles folders and files from the `data` directory into a distributable format, making it easier to manage versioning and distribution.
    
* `tests`: Contains scripts and commands for running tests. These bash scripts are used to validate the functionality of the application through automated testing procedures.
    
* `sample`: In this directory, sample test files are stored. These are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the application or to provide templates for users to follow.
    
* `source`: The main source files of the application are located here. It is the heart of the project, containing the primary logic, algorithms, and functionality.
    
* `scripts`: Additional scripts related to camera control and other auxiliary functions can be found here. These are not the main executable scripts but support the application, often interfacing with external hardware or services.
