; Configurations for PIV camera grab signal
; exposure_time_in_ms: int - The exposure time of the camera in milliseconds
; dt_in_ms: int - The time interval between two consecutive images in milliseconds
; Frequency: int - The frequency of the camera in Hz
; Duration_in_sec: int - The duration of the camera recording in seconds
; Height: int - The height of the captured image in pixels
; Width: int - The width of the captured image in pixels

; Sample Test Case
exposure_time_in_ms = 2
dt_in_ms = 10
Frequency = 10
Duration_in_sec = 600
Height = 400
Width = 1000

; The following parameters are used to set the camera's parameters.
; The parameters are set using the following formula:
; num_cameras = Frequency * Duration_in_sec * 2
